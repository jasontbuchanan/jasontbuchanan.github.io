Jason Thorpe Buchanan is an American composer of operatic, orchestral, chamber, electroacoustic, and intermedia works that explore fragmentation, multiplicity, oscillation between intelligibility and unintelligibility, and the integration of live performance with technology. He is currently Artistic Director of the [Switch~ Ensemble] and Department Chair/Lecturer in Composition, Music Theory, and Electronic Music Composition at the College of Music, Mahidol University in Thailand. His works have been described as “an unearthly collage of sounds”, “sharply-edged”, and “free jazz gone wrong—in a good way.”

But how much we learn when we come back a second time, or at intervals over the course of months or years. *Tarr* is one such piece that continues to teach and continues to expand an understanding of Sivan's musical interreferrentiality, exploding one precisely drawn frame with a seemingly smaller one. And one doesn't have to dig very far to uncover sedimentations of broader musical and artistic reference. In *Tarr* one finds intersections and distillations of consciously unresolved ideas present in larger works. They crystallize in these minor forms and take on the quality of pearls, drawn deep from the sediments of thought, effort and happy irritation.

*Tarr* is a quintet recomposition of Sivan's orchestral work *A Thousand Tongues* (also 2014). Quite a few phrasal, harmonic and structural features remain intact. A sinuous bass clarinet solo opens both pieces, constantly receding from its approaching, the resonance of the instrument muffled by use of quarter-tone fingerings. The alto flute's whispers, breaths and trills cast an eerie spell of the regularity of breathing over both ensembles, just as clearly audible in a larger orchestra as in the intimacy of chamber music.

About two-thirds of the way through, where *A Thousand Tongues* emerges in mercurial massiveness and the orchestration of each crescendo evaporates ever upwards, *Tarr* re-imagines this ascent as a wispy flute line, rocking between breath and tone. At the end of the ascent, a listener with an ear tuned to the past hears a quotation from Charles Ives's song *Serenity* in twice-iterated falling chords in the piano. This is where *Tarr* begins to point outside of itself. The text of *Serenity* (a setting of Whittier) generally implores the reader to recognize peace at the close of one's life, implying a move away from language and mundane matters towards beauty in the peace of presumably accepting death.

<em>O, Sabbath rest of Galilee!</em><br>
<em>O, calm of hills above,</em><br>
<em>Where Jesus knelt to share with Thee,</em><br>
<em>The silence of eternity</em><br>
<em>Interpreted by love.</em><br>
<em>Drop Thy still dews of quietness,</em><br>
<em>Till all our strivings cease:</em><br>
<em>Take from our souls the strain and stress,</em><br>
<em>And let our ordered lives confess,</em><br>
<em>The beauty of Thy peace.</em>

When one listens to Sivan's music for long enough, one starts to hear voices. Not voices of psychological incertitude, but voices borne from the shores of memory. It would be reckless in a consideration of Sivan's work to overlook her exploration of the sensual qualities of the voice and its language, which form one of the main gravitational centers around which orbits her musical thought. *Tarr* among other instrumental writing is pulled into this orbit. The initial bass clarinet solo is a transcription of the speaking voice in her radio work for theater *On Air \| Behind Glass*, commissioned by Czech Radio's rAdioCUSTICA Program, and featured in the 2013 play *Antiwords.*

In *On Air \| Behind Glass* one hears speaking, but not in any language intelligible to the speakers of this world. What one hears instead is a non-sense chant-like language with syllables that recall meaning in timbre and sound, and gesture to meaning-making in their contour. A further collapse of its words is enacted through transcription, though perhaps meaning-signifiers remain intact in the prosodic nature of the bass clarinet writing. Another type of language is constructed, non-logical, but sonically pointing towards meaning. It is a non-logic that makes possible the transformation of breath into rain into mouths into trains into memory and from memory emerges a voice, whispering. This non-logic is a site where the ephemera of the voice, a slight whistle in exhalation, becomes the far-off whistle of someone signaling from a different country. Throughout, language sheds itself for something less encumbered, more immediately sensuous in its impressions.

Sivan pointed me towards another intersection at language's vanishing point, the work of Hungarian film director Béla Tarr. Of Tarr's epic films, *The Turin Horse*, co-written with novelist László Krasznahorkai, focuses on a potato farmer, his daughter, and the horse they own. It is implied that they are the owners of the horse that Nietzsche witnessed being beaten, after which he suffered a mental breakdown. As Nietzsche in his last years became mute with dementia (it is purported that his last words were "Mutter, ich bin dumm" [Mother, I am stupid]), the potato farmer and his daughter also move away from language and earthly concerns as the film progresses and an approaching storm envelops their farm.

In 1902 Hugo von Hoffmansthal wrote *The Letter of Lord Chandos* in which Lord Chandos writes to Francis Bacon in August of 1603 why he will never write again. Throughout the letter Chandos/Hoffmansthal describes the slow unfolding of a crisis in language, where he finds insufficient every word and grammatical formation to express the ecstatic specificity of objects and sensations at their particular moment of sustained ephemerality. At the close of the letter, he implores his deficiency with the proposition of a different kind of language that points towards the agential nature of objects.

> *...because the language in which I might be able not only to write but to think is neither Latin nor English, neither Italian nor Spanish, but a language none of whose words is known to me, a language in which inanimate things speak to me and wherein I may one day have to justify myself before an unknown judge.*

Perhaps something deeply restorative is at play in Sivan's music. Perhaps her music acts as an incantation through which the memories of these lost and abandoned voices wash ashore- their language reconfigured, meaning-anew, and pointing. But to where?

⋅⋅⋅Jason is the recipient of a 2010-11 Fulbright Fellowship at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Hamburg (DE) as a visiting scholar, a fellowship and commissions from Royaumont for soliloquios del viento (2016) for the Talea Ensemble+EXAUDI Vocal Ensemble and ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY (2017) for the Académie Voix Nouvelles Ensemble, a 2015 American-Scandinavian Foundation Grant, a 2014 commission from the International Horn Society and 2015 ASCAP Morton Gould Award for Double Concerto (2014) written for the Eastman Musica Nova Ensemble, soloists Jeff Nelsen, Michael Walker, and conductor Brad Lubman, a 2014 ASCAP Morton Gould Award & Howard Hanson Orchestral Prize (2014) for Asymptotic Flux: Second Study in Entropy (2013) commissioned by the Mizzou International Composers Festival for Alarm Will Sound, a commission from the Blue Water Chamber Orchestra as winner of Iron Composer (2014), commissions from Ensemble Nikel (2014) and Iktus Percussion (2013), the German/American Fulbright Commission (2011) and winner of newEar Composer’s Competition (2013).

⋅⋅⋅In 2015, as Artist-in-Residence at USF Verftet/City Council of Bergen, Norway and nominee for the Gaudeamus Prize, three works were presented by Insomnio, New European Ensemble, and Slagwerk Den Haag at Gaudeamus Muziekweek (NL). His works walkside, lost and gimme shelter (2015), commissioned by Gaudeamus Muziekweek and Eklekto Percussion Geneva, both explore the structural intersection of precise physical gestures, fragile sounds, and speech alongside live audio and video processing. Three speaking percussionists manipulate household objects, microphones, and speakers embedded in wooden boxes while cameras generate a reservoir of video files. These files are retrieved, re-organized, and composited against one another, creating temporal, aural, and visual dissonances between past and present actions. As 2018 Artist-In-Residence at the Embassy of Foreign Artists in Geneva, Switzerland, he developed a new, interactive processing environment for surface, tension (2018), responding directly to the discrete physical gestures of performers and governing the behavior of both signal processing and soundfile triggering through wearable technology, sensors, and motion tracking.

⋅⋅⋅PANIC ARCHITECTURE (2017), commissioned by the Earle Brown Music Foundation for the Talea Ensemble and TIME SPANS Festival in NYC, evokes a participatory framework demanding compulsive interaction and attention. The relentless influx of email, messages, and notifications compel our constant engagement and response, functioning as both our tether to society and primary mode of interpersonal contact. Intermittent reinforcement entices users to obsessively check for new content. Digital panic occurs when multiple, simultaneous systems demand a user’s attention concurrently.

⋅⋅⋅Scenes from his multimedia opera Hunger have received performances at Darmstadt (2014) with Ensemble Interface (DE), The Industry’s FIRST TAKE in L.A. (2015) with wild Up, and the MATA Interval Series in New York City (2015) with the [Switch~ Ensemble]. “Hunger is a kind of training session in mental disintegration… An ungodly opera needs ugly music, singers who produce primal sounds, an electric guitar that sounds scraped raw, a wailing orchestra effects, cuts the ear like a knife. Buchanan delivers.” – L.A. Times

⋅⋅⋅all-forgetting-is-retrieval (2019) for ensemble and augmented conductor was commissioned by the Thailand New Music and Arts Symposium, exploring the formation of human memory, retrieval, failure, and the emotional space of “lost” experiences—the inability to be truly present in a moment, or further commit to memory experiences that are simultaneously both formative and fleeting. The rapid loss of their fidelity is staggering, and this work attempt to confront that impermanence and decay.

⋅⋅⋅Primary mentors have included Ricardo Zohn-Muldoon, Steven Takasugi, Pierluigi Billone, Chaya Czernowin, Raphaël Cendo, David Liptak, Virko Baley, Peter Michael Hamel, Jorge Villavicencio Grossmann, Pablo Furman, and Georges Aperghis. Jason served for three years as Executive Director of the Valencia International Performance Academy & Festival (Spain), for two years as a Curator for the San Francisco Center for New Music, and as founding Director of the TICF Academy for Young Composers, as well as course instructor in electronic music and composition, board member of OSSIA, and assistant conductor for the Musica Nova Ensemble with conductor Brad Lubman at the Eastman School of Music.

⋅⋅⋅He is widely sought internationally as a guest composer and lecturer at institutions including the University of Virginia, San Jose State University, UNLV, Queens New Music Festival, MATA, UT Austin, Tzlil Meudcan Festival (Tel Aviv), Hamilton College, Chamber Music Campania (Italy), Portland State University, TRANSIT Festival Belgium, University of Richmond, UNCG, Michigan State University, University of Northern Colorado, the Bergen Center for Elektronisk Kunst (BEK) in Norway, the University of Chicago, and Stanford University. He holds a Ph.D. in Composition from the Eastman School of Music, and degrees in Composition and Music Technology from San José State University (BM & BA, 2008) and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (MM, 2010), where he taught courses in composition and theory. Current projects include the multimedia opera Hunger, and a large work for the Hong Kong New Music Ensemble commissioned by the MATA Festival in NYC (2020). www.jasonthorpebuchanan.com
